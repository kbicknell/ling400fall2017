For this assignment, we're going to generate some interesting text that we'll later analyze. Specifically, you'll each write a brief biography of yourself. Include things such as:

* where you're from
* what brought you to your current graduate program (e.g., MSiA)?
* what did you do before this program?
* when did you become interested in text analytics?
* what are your plans for the future?
* whatever else you want to include!

Aim for something like 300--600 words.
